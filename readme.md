Web Development ePortfolio CET138 ( ISMT COLLEGE )

Project Overview

This project is an ePortfolio showcasing foundational web development skills using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It demonstrates the ability to create structured, styled, responsive, and interactive web pages, with practical examples and live demos.

⸻

Features
	•	Structured Web Pages: Semantic HTML elements for accessible and organized content.
	•	Styling and Layout: CSS and Bootstrap for responsive design, consistent typography, and visual hierarchy.
	•	Interactive Elements: JavaScript functionality including button click counters and form validation.
	•	Responsive Design: Pages adapt to different screen sizes using Bootstrap’s grid system and CSS Flexbox/Grid.
	•	Code Organization: Clean and maintainable structure for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

⸻

Technologies Used
	•	HTML5: Provides the structure and semantic elements of the web pages.
	•	CSS3: Handles styling, layout, and responsiveness.
	•	Bootstrap 5: Pre-built components and grid system for rapid development.
	•	JavaScript: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to pages.

Project Sections

Full Stack Concept

Demonstrates understanding of full stack workflow:

Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) ↔ Backend (Node.js/PHP/Python) ↔ Database (MySQL/MongoDB)

HTML
	•	Semantic structure using <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <footer>.
	•	Forms, tables, lists, and links for user interaction.

Example:

<p>This is a paragraph with <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, and a <a href="#">link</a>.</p>

CSS
	•	Styles content with colors, fonts, and layout.
	•	Implements Flexbox/Grid for responsive design.

Example:

<p style="color: blue;">This text is blue using CSS.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">This text is bold.</p>

Bootstrap
	•	Uses pre-built components like buttons, alerts, cards, and a grid system.
	•	Ensures responsive layouts without writing extensive CSS.

Example:

<button class="btn btn-primary">Bootstrap Button</button>
<div class="alert alert-success mt-3">This is a Bootstrap alert!</div>

JavaScript
	•	Adds interactivity through DOM manipulation and event handling.
	•	Includes features like click counters and form validation.

Example:

<button onclick="incrementCounter()">Click Me</button>
<p id="counter">Button clicked: 0 times</p>

<script>
let count = 0;
function incrementCounter() {
  count++;
  document.getElementById('counter').innerText = `Button clicked: ${count} times`;
}
</script>
